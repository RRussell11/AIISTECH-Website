SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS
======================

To complete the WordPress theme, you need to add a screenshot.png file.

Recommended specifications:
- Dimensions: 1200x900 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Shows a preview of the theme's homepage

You can create this by:
1. Taking a screenshot of your website homepage
2. Resizing it to 1200x900 pixels
3. Saving it as 'screenshot.png' in the theme root directory

For now, a placeholder can be created with any image editor or online tool.
