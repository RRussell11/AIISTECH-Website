**Development of Microservices**

Here is a structured list of potential **microservices** you can offer, aligned with PSA \+ intelligent automation and domain-oriented design.[\[1\]](#bookmark=id.5bk1r735lnv0)[\[2\]](#bookmark=id.39xpimu25wj6)[\[3\]](#bookmark=id.54utgmn9qkbi)

* **Automation Catalog Service**  
  Registry of available automations (AP processing, claims intake, AML checks) with parameters and SLAs.

* **Automation Execution API Service**  
  Single API façade to invoke automations as microservices (idempotent, composable “automation endpoints”).[\[2\]](#bookmark=id.39xpimu25wj6)[\[4\]](#bookmark=id.4iq4x4b53sji)

* **Exception & Incident Handling Service**  
  Captures bot failures, classifies exceptions, routes to humans or agents, and tracks resolution SLAs.

* **Process Mining & Discovery Service**  
  Analyzes logs/event streams to identify candidates, volumes, and bottlenecks for automation.

* **Task Queue & Work Routing Service**  
  Routes human tasks and approvals generated by automations (e.g., exceptions needing review).

* **Compliance & Audit Trail Service**  
  Stores detailed event logs for all automations, user actions, and decisions (regulatory-grade).

**Agentic AI / intelligence microservices**

* **Document Understanding Service**  
  Uses OCR \+ LLM to extract structured data from invoices, claims, forms, lab reports, and contracts.

* **Knowledge Retrieval (RAG) Service**  
  Connects to SharePoint, Confluence, policy docs, and provides grounded answers/contexts to agents.

* **Decisioning & Policy Engine Service**  
  Encodes rules \+ ML models to decide approvals, route work, or choose which automation to run.

* **Exception Reasoning Agent Service**  
  Investigates failed cases (e.g., denied claims, AML flags), generates explanations, and suggests fixes.

* **Forecasting & Optimization Service**  
  Provides demand forecasts, staffing recommendations, and “what-if” scenario simulations for projects.

* **Natural-Language Command Service**  
  Accepts text prompts (“automate our prior auth workflow”) and maps them to automation templates.

**Vertical-specific microservices**

**Healthcare**

* **Prior Authorization Orchestration Service**  
  Handles data gathering, payer-specific form generation, submission, and status tracking.

* **Claims Intake & Submission Service**  
  Normalizes claim data, validates codes, and submits via EDI/API or portal automation.

* **Denial Management Service**  
  Clusters denials, suggests root causes, and triggers workflows to appeal or correct data.

* **EOB & Payment Posting Service**  
  Reconciles remittance advice with claims and posts to GL / patient accounts.

**Manufacturing**

* **Quality Inspection Service**  
  Accepts QC measurements/images, applies rules/ML, and records pass/fail with traceability.

* **Production & Inventory Sync Service**  
  Automates updates between MES/ERP/warehouse systems; manages SKU and stock events.

* **Regulatory Compliance Log Service**  
  Maintains audit-ready records for ISO/FDA inspections linked to automated steps.

**BFSI**

* **KYC Onboarding Service**  
  Automates identity verification, document checks, and risk scoring for new customers.

* **AML Transaction Monitoring Service**  
  Ingests transactions, applies rules/ML alerts, and creates SAR workflows.

* **Regulatory Reporting Service**  
  Generates mandated reports (e.g., SAR, CTR, Basel templates) from core data stores.

**Integration & platform microservices**

* **CRM Integration Service**  
  Syncs accounts, opportunities, and projects with Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.[\[5\]](#bookmark=id.wgfvl9ol36pe)[\[6\]](#bookmark=id.70ia34ri4h18)

* **Accounting Integration Service**  
  Connects to QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, and keeps invoices/payments in sync.

* **Calendar & Collaboration Integration Service**  
  Syncs events and tasks with Google/Microsoft 365; posts updates to Slack/Teams channels.

* **API Gateway / Developer Portal Service**  
  Central entrypoint for external devs, key management, rate limiting, and API documentation.[\[7\]](#bookmark=id.cqx6c5nf9uor)[\[1\]](#bookmark=id.5bk1r735lnv0)

* **Usage Metering & Billing Service**  
  Tracks per-tenant/API usage, seats, automations run, and feeds into subscription billing.

**Governance, security, and lifecycle microservices**

* **Tenant Policy & Compliance Service**  
  Stores policies for data residency, retention, encryption, and allowed integrations.

* **Feature Flag & Experimentation Service**  
  Gradually rolls out features to subsets of tenants; supports A/B testing.

* **Schema & Migration Service**  
  Manages versioned schemas for each bounded context and data migrations.

* **Health & Observability Service**  
  Aggregates metrics, logs, traces for all microservices and automations.

If helpful, the next step can be to pick 6–8 of these as **initial microservices for MVP**, then map each to concrete endpoints, data contracts, and responsible teams.
