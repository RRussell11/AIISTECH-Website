**AIISTECH: Comprehensive Client-Facing Overview**

**Executive Summary**

AIISTECH is an **AI-driven Professional Services Automation (PSA) platform integrated with intelligent automation services** targeting mid-market enterprises (500–5,000 employees) seeking to eliminate operational friction and unlock 280–320% ROI within 18 months.

**The Core Value Proposition**: We provide a unified stack where the PSA platform becomes the operating system for workflow automation, combining:

* **AIISTECH Org** – AI-powered PSA platform (project management, time tracking, billing, resource planning, real-time analytics)

* **Intelligent Automation Services** – RPA and agentic AI implementation, managed services, and strategic advisory

* **Recurring Revenue Model** – Managed services (RaaS) generating 50%+ recurring revenue by Year 5

**Market Opportunity: Why Now?**

**Market Size & Growth**

* **RPA Market**: $35.3B (2026) → $100B+ (2030); **24.2% CAGR**

* **PSA Market**: $8.5B (2026) → $15.8B (2030); **16.8% CAGR**

* **Addressable Mid-Market TAM**: $3.5B (2026) → $8.4B (2030); **24% CAGR**

**Key Inflection Points**

1. **2026**: Agentic AI transforms RPA from task-based to orchestration-based; service firms desperate for cost control

2. **2027–2028**: 30–40% of RPA projects fail → high-margin remediation opportunities

3. **2029–2030**: Market consolidation; 95% of enterprises have automation programs; shift to optimization and outsourced CoE models

**Vertical Adoption Leaders**

* **BFSI**: 36.5% of RPA market (KYC, AML, claims processing)

* **Manufacturing**: 35% (quality control, supply chain, compliance)

* **Healthcare**: 10% but fastest growth (+18% YoY) – claims processing, prior authorization, patient intake

* **Professional Services**: 12% highest willingness to pay (time/billing automation)

**Competitive Positioning: We Are NOT a Platform Vendor**

**The Gap We Fill**

Large RPA vendors (UiPath 35.8%, Microsoft Power Automate 18.4%, Automation Anywhere 14.9%) focus on bot-building. We uniquely position as the **"Intelligent Automation Partner"** that:
